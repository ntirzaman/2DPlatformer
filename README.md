#About the Project
This is my first complete game. It's a simple 2D platformer that aims to take at least 10 minutes of playing (or maybe even more depending on your skill level). 
I wanted a way to showcase a lot of the skills I've learned in game development, and this is the result of a that. I hope you enjoy the game!
(Certain levels might prove challenging, but rest assured that I have tested every jump, every enemy interaction, and every single level to make sure that it is completable given enough coordination, timing or skill.)

#Built With
Godot 4.3

#Installation
It should be as easy as installing the .exe project file and running the game.

#License and Usage
This game is for playing only. The default copyright laws state that no one may reproduce, distribute, or create deerivative works from my work.
